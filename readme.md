#WordPress Integration#

The aim of this project was to convert my personal site to a WordPress theme. I really enjoy the blogging functionality that ships with WordPress. Compared to the blogging system supported by Jekyll, it's very clear that if your primary focus is content-creation, a CMS system connected to a database is superior in a number of ways.

In the near future I intend to implement SEO and a small e-commerce section.
