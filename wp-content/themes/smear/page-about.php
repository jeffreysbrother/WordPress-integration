      <p class="text-muted">My name is James Cool. I'm usually interested in music, and I'm sometimes interested in philosophy. I've also recently picked up programming and photography.</p>

      <p class="text-muted">In terms of programming, I am focusing primarily on web development. This site was built using Bootstrap, PHP, Git, Grunt, and a bit of Sass. I've also utilized an image gallery by <a href="https://github.com/blueimp" target="_blank">Sebastian Tschan</a>, some icon fonts by <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="_blank">Dave Gandy</a>, and a Treehouse widget by <a href="https://github.com/rileyhilliard" target="_blank">Riley Hilliard</a> (which can be used to see my progress at Treehouse <a href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/treehouse/">here</a>).</p>

      <p class="text-muted">In philosophy, I am mostly interested in belief and justification. I occasionally find myself fiddling with an epistemological model that treats truth as subjective evaluation of accuracy, belief as a suspicion of this accuracy, and knowledge as nothing beyond either a feeling of certainty or a retroactive evaluation. My view of art is that the concept is relatively useless. My general outlook is empiricist, nominalistic, and fallibilistic in nature. Abstract entities and moral laws, I think, are genuine fictions. Belief appears involuntary, determinism false. There are judgments, emotional responses, and actions; a lot of silliness comes from ignoring the differences between them and by failing to grasp the difference between practical and theoretical reasoning.</p>
